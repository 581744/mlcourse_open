[About](https://habrahabr.ru/company/ods/blog/334960/) the course on Habrahabr. [Youtube-channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVlY_7IJCMJdgcCtQfzj5j8OVB_Y0GJCl) with lecture videos (in Russian). The course is discussed in the #mlcourse_open channel in the [OpenDataScience](http://ods.ai/) Slack team.

The course aims at developing both theoretical understanding of main machine learning concepts and practical skills of applying DS/ML techniques for solving real-world tasks. For this purpose, on one hand, the Habrahabr articles are full of math but on the other hand, there are lots of homeworks and several Kaggle competitions held throughout the course. Moreover, participants come up with their own [tutorials](https://goo.gl/6T53d7) on DS/ML topics and convey [individual projects](https://goo.gl/KHB4cL). 

Among prerequisites for comfortably passing the course are basic Python skills and acquaintance with math concepts (calculus, linear algebra, probability theory and statistics) from the 2-nd year's high school curriculum.
